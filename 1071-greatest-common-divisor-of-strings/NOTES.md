We first need to check if GCD is even possible among the two strings.
Two strings str1 and str2 will have gcd if and only if **str1+str2 == str2+str1**.
If both the strings are made of same substring concatenated multiple times then they will have GCD.

How to find the length of gcd?
- gcd of both strings length.
