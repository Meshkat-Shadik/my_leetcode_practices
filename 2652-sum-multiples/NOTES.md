if n = 14,
then for 3's multiples in the range of 14 are
3,6,9,12
Now, 3+6+9+12
= 3(1+2+3+4)
for, 1+2+3+4 it is, 4*(4+1)/2
now we need 4, where did the 4 came from in the manner of 14 and 3
it is 14/3 = int (4.something)
​
finally, it is,
= 3\*(4\*(4+1)/2)  = 3\*((14/3)\*((14/3)+1)/2)
​
so, for x's multiple and n's number we can write,
### = x \*((n/x)\*((n/x)+1)/2)
​
​
then from the set theory of
( A U B U C )  =  A + B + C - AnB - AnC - BnC + AnBnC
